# Specification for "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"

## 1. Project Overview

*   **Project Name**: `physical-ai-humanoid-robotics`
*   **Goal**: To create a complete, university-level online textbook about Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
*   **Platform**: Docusaurus.

## 2. Core Features

*   **AI-Powered Content**: Use GPT-based models for generating and assisting with written content.
*   **Visuals**: Use Mermaid.js to generate diagrams (SVG) for clear illustrations.
*   **Automation**: Implement auto-generation for repetitive content or structures, including **automatically producing all pages**.
*   **UX**: Ensure the Docusaurus site has a consistent and clear navigation structure.

## 3. Learning Objectives

The primary learning outcome is for students to apply AI knowledge to control humanoid robots in both simulation and real-world scenarios.
