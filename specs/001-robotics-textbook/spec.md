# Specification for "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"

## 1. Project Overview

*   **Project Name**: `physical-ai-humanoid-robotics`
*   **Goal**: To create a complete, university-level online textbook about Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
*   **Target Audience**: University students with a background in programming and AI.

## 2. User Scenarios

*   **Scenario 1: Student reads a chapter**
    *   A student navigates to a chapter of the textbook.
    *   The student reads the text, views diagrams, and examines code samples.
    *   The student can easily navigate to the next/previous chapter and other sections of the book.

*   **Scenario 2: Student completes a lab exercise**
    *   A student follows the instructions for a lab exercise.
    *   The student can copy and paste code snippets from the textbook.
    *   The student successfully completes the exercise and achieves the desired learning outcome.

## 3. Functional Requirements

*   The online textbook shall be presented in a user-friendly, web-based format.
*   The content shall be organized into chapters and modules.
*   The textbook shall include text, diagrams, and code samples.
*   The navigation structure shall be clear and consistent, allowing users to easily browse the content.
*   The textbook shall be accessible on modern web browsers.

## 4. Success Criteria

*   **Completion**: The textbook is considered complete when it covers the 4 planned modules.
*   **Clarity**: 90% of students surveyed report that the textbook is clear and easy to understand.
*   **Usability**: 95% of students surveyed report that the website is easy to navigate.
*   **Engagement**: At least 80% of students complete all the lab exercises.

## 5. Scope

*   **In Scope**:
    *   Creation of a 4-module online textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
    *   The textbook will cover topics such as robotic middleware, simulation, and humanoid robot development.
    *   The textbook will include text, diagrams, and code samples.

*   **Out of Scope**:
    *   User accounts and progress tracking.
    *   Interactive exercises or quizzes beyond the provided lab instructions.
    *   A forum or community for students.

## 6. Edge Cases

*   The website should still be usable on browsers with JavaScript disabled, although some features might not be available.
*   Diagrams should have a text-based alternative for accessibility.
*   Code samples should be displayed correctly regardless of the user's screen size.

## 7. Assumptions

*   The content for the textbook will be generated with AI assistance.
*   Diagrams will be created using a text-based diagramming tool.

## 8. Dependencies

*   None.
